I did have to share the lottery *win* with 119 others. You see, there were even more deranged individuals besides myself who entered the chance to race 340 miles of rural Iowa gravel roads. In April when the weather is entirely unpredictable. Within 34 hours. Not knowing the route ahead of time. Self navigated. With a handful of checkpoints and probably fewer convenience stores for resupply. Oh, and no outside support allowed.  

Did I say there were 120 spots available and there was more demand, forcing a lottery to get into this free event? A few years back I entered the lottery to get into [Trans Iowa](http://transiowa.blogspot.com/), but *lost*. Trans Iowa was the predecessor to this race, called [Iowa Wind and Rock](https://iowawindandrock.com/). Might be more like mud and pebbles. Nonetheless, I'm in! This could simultaneously be the dumbest and best thing I've ever done.

Might as well fire up a blog to document the journey to April 20th, 2019. I suppose I'll do a race report too afterwards, if I have enough strength left to tap the keyboard. The blog is really for me, not you (no offense). Don't worry, you'll have plenty of opportunities to laugh at me. Until next time...
